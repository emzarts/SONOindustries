### Secondary Life Support in Case of Emergencies: A Message from CEO John Samuels
#### May 5th, 1979

*Message begins*

**John Samuels**: Here at Sono Industries we realize that we put our scientists under a lot of pressure- 1,830,000 N/m2 to be exact- haha! Wait, I am not supposed to make jokes? You didn’t tell me that you were recording this! Damn it, Janet! Well, um, - here at Sono Industries we locate our facility 2.25 miles underground because according to our legal team it is the best way to stay out of trouble with the government for illegal test- I mean, um, zoning issues. They can’t get you for building in a residential area if the entire facility is underground! SUCK IT CARTER! HA! 

*The tape cuts off* 

**John Samuels**: Hello, my name is John Samuels, CEO of Sono Industries, where we take pride in the safety of our hard-working faculty members. Due to the construction and location of our building, proper regulation of oxygen and exportation of resources to our technicians is of the utmost concern to maintaining a living, breathing faculty. Therefore, we implemented a Secondary Life Support Mechanism in the case of cave-ins and exit obstruction. Just enter the life preservation chamber, and activate the Secondary Life Support Mechanism. Once activated, it releases a melatonin-based cloud that will allow those who breathe it in to fall into a deep sleep, preserving a body in homeostasis up to 25 years! HOLY CRAP, JANET! DID YOU SEE THIS!?!? 25 WHOLE- sorry. You won’t need it for 25 years though, because help will arrive to remove the obstruction within 2-3 weeks, and a member of the help squad will activate life support, taking you out of the deep sleep. It’ll take so long because the removal has to remain unnoticed by Old Man Davis, who thinks the above ground entrance to the facility is an old outhouse. Hey hasn’t that guy croaked yet? He’s been on that land for eighty godda-

*The tape cuts off* 
 
**Note**: Sono Industries would also like to note the side effects of the melatonin cloud mentioned in the statement above:
Severe Memory Loss, Loss of Appetite, Soreness and Annoyance with the Author for Amnesia as a Plot Device.
